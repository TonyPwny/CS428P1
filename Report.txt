Our project involves taking the initial assignment, "Roll a Ball" and integrating AI opponents in order to create a singleplayer experience.
The AI have been developed using various methods learned during this course. Mainly, IBT and Social Forces are used to dictate AI Antagonistic
behaviour. Using the IBT, we can tell the adversaries to Patrol until the time limit is reached. In addition, using a SequenceParallel we can 
direct the adversaries to Pursue and Attack. If the player has obtained the key item, the adversaries will also attempt to jump on the user's 
character. The adversaries also use social forces in order to take into account the movement of their neighbours and work as a crowd. Once the 
target is within perception range, the user is set as the goal destination for the adversary and will path towards it while taking into account
the forces acted upon it by its perceived neighbours. 

Controls And Goal:
In our game, the user uses WASD to move and Space to jump. ESC can be used to reset the game. Press Enter to close the instructions and start 
the game. The user must collect the key in the bottom left of the map. The user then must traverse the map while attempting to avoid the
enemies. If an enemy jumps on the user, the key is dropped and must be recovered. (Using space to jump over enemies when the user is 
surrounded is helpful in recovery) If the user has the key item at the end of the map and walks into the spotlight, the user wins.
